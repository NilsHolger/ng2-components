    <h3>The basic building blocks of Angular applications</h3>
    <p>
      Angular is a Single Page Application Framework for writing applications in HTML5/CSS3 using either pure JavaScript, Dart or TypeScript.
      TypeScript is transpiled to JavaScript. Find a brief introduction to TypeScript <a href="http://nilsnaegele.com/codeedge/typescript1.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      Since the Angular and Ionic Teams use this extension of JavaScript we know what must be done. I encourage you to code through
      the hero tutorial and become an <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/" target="_blank">Open Source Hero</a>. For all who do good
      and make humanity advance, pure of heart and with no personal gain intentions is a hero. Angular is hero technology and once you have worked
      through the tutorial you will understand the purity and beauty of this technology for writing single page applications. The framework consists of many libraries,
      some of them core, some of them optional. You write Angular applications by composing HTML templates with Angularized markup, writing component classes to manage those
      templates, adding application logic in services and boxing components and services in modules. Then you launch the app by bootstrapping the root module 
      Angular takes over, presenting your application content in a browser, I recommend Chrome for development and newest standards reasons. Everybody develops and browses
      in Chrome today. Another good alternative is Firefox from Mozilla, also good for development and browsing. Even though Chrome has superior functionalities to be perfectly honest.
      Angular responds to user interactions in the browser according to instructions you've provided.
    </p>
    <p>Let's have a look at the big picture:</p>
    <img src="../../images/angulararchitecture1.PNG">
    <h4>Modules</h4>
    <p>
        Angular apps are modular and Angular has its own modularity system called Angular modules or NgModules. Angular modules are a big
        deal. This page introduces modules; the <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html" target="_blank">Angular modules page</a> covers them more in depth.
        Every Angular app has at least one Angular module class, the <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/appmodule.html" target="_blank">root module</a>, conventionally named AppModule.
         While the root module may be the only module in a small application, most apps have many more feature modules, each a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain,
         a work flow, or a closely related set of capabilities. An Angular module, whether a root or feature, is a class with an @NgModule decorator. 
       <b>Decorators are functions that modify JavaScript classes. Angular has many decorators that attach metdata to classes so that it knows
      what those classes mean and how they should work. <a href="https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841#.mer5rbseu" target="_blank">Learn more
      </a> about decorators on the web.</b>
    </p>
    <p>NgModule is a decorator function that takes a single metadata object whose properties describe the module. The most important
      properties are:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>declarations - the view classes that belong to this module. Angular has three kinds of view classes: <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/architecture.html#!#components" target="blank">components</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/architecture.html#!#directives" target="_blank">directives</a> and <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/pipes.html" target="_blank">pipes</a>.</li>
        <li>exports - the subset of declarations that should be visible and usable in the component templates of other modules.</li>
        <li>import - other modules whose exported classes are needed by component templates declared in this module.</li>
        <li>providers - creators of <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/architecture.html#!#services" target="_blank">services</a> that this module contributes to the global collection of services; they become accessible in all parts of the app.</li>
        <li>bootstrap - the main application view, called the root component, that hosts all other app views. Only the root module should set this bootstrap property.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here's a simple root module:</p>
      <small>app/app.module.ts</small>
      <pre>
        <code>
          import {{'{'}} NgModule {{'}'}} from '@angular/core';
          import {{'{'}} BrowserModule {{'}'}} from '@angular/platform-browser';
          @NgModule({{'{'}}
            imports: [BrowserModule],
            providers: [Logger],
            declarations: [AppComponent],
            exports: [AppComponent],
            bootstrap: [AppComponent]          
          {{'}'}})
          export class AppModule {{'{'}}{{'}'}}   
          </code>
        </pre>
        <b>The export of AppComponent is just to show how to export; it isn't actually necessary in this example. A root module
          has no reason to export anything because other components don't need to import the root module.</b>
    <p>
      Launch an application by bootstrapping its root module. During development you're likely to bootstrap the AppModule in a main.ts
      file like this one.
    </p>
    <small>app/main.ts</small>
    <pre>
      <code>
        import {{'{'}}platformBrowserDynamic{{'}'}} from '@angular-platform-browser-dynamic';
        import {{'{'}}AppModule{{'}'}} from './app.module';
        platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Angular Modules versus JavaScript Modules</h3>
    <p>
      The Angular module -- a class decorated with @NgModule -- is a fundamental feature of Angular.
      JavaScript also has its own module system for managing collections of JavaScript objects. It's completely different and unrelated
      to the Angular module system. In JavaScript each file is a module and all objects defined in that file belong to the module.
      The module declares some objects to be public by marking them with the export key word. Other JavaScript modules use import statements
      to access public objects from other modules.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        import {{'{'}}NgModule{{'}'}} from '@angular/core';
        import {{'{'}}AppComponent{{'}'}} from './app.component';
        export class AppModule{{'{'}}{{'}'}}
      </code>
    </pre>

    <b><a href="http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html" target="_blank">Learn more about the JavaScript module system on the web</a>.</b>
    <p>These are two different and complementary module systems. Use them both to write your apps.</p>

    <h3>Angular Libraries</h3>
    <img src="../../images/angularlibraries1.PNG">
    <p>Angular ships as a collection of JavaScript modules. You can think of them as library modules. Each Angular library name
    begins with the @angular prefix. You install them with the npm package manager and import parts of them  with JavaScript import
    statements. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, import Angular's Component decorator from the @angular/core library like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        import {{'{'}}Component{{'}'}} from '@angular/core';
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      You also import Angular modules from Angular libraries using JavaScript import statements: 
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        import {{'{'}}BrowserModule{{'}'}} from '@angular/platform-browser';
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>In the example of the simple root module above, the application module needs material from within that BrowserModule. to
      access that material , add it to the @NgModule metadata imports like this.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        imports: [BrowserModule],
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In this way you are using both the Angular and JavaScript module systems together.</p>

    <h3>Components</h3>
    <img src="../../images/angularcomponents1.PNG">
    <p>
      Say hello to Carmen view she stands strong. A component controls a patch of screen called a view. For example, the following views are controlled by components:
      the app root with the navigation links, the list of heroes, the hero editor. You define a component's application logic
      -- what it does to support the view -- inside a class. The class interacts with the view through an API of properties 
      and methods. For example, this HeroListComponent has a heroes property that returns an array of heroes that it acquires
      from a service. HeroListComponent also has a selectHero() method that sets a selectedHero property when the user clicks
      to choose a hero from that list. 
    </p>
    <small>app/hero-list.component.ts(class)</small>
    <pre>
      <code>
        export class HeroListComponent implements OnInit {{'{'}}
                      heroes: Heroes[];
                      selectedHero: Hero;

                      constructor(private heroService: HeroService) {{'{'}}{{'}'}}
                      ngOnInit() {{'{'}}
                            this.heroes = this.heroService.getHeroes();
                      {{'}'}}
                      selectHero(hero: Hero) {{'{'}} this.selectedHero = hero;{{'}'}}
        {{'}'}}
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Angular creates, updates, and destroys components as the user moves through the application. Your app can take action at each moment
      in the lifecycle through optional <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/lifecycle-hooks.html" target="_blank">lifecycle hooks</a>, like ngOnInit declared above.

    </p>
    <h3>Templates</h3>
    <img src="../../images/angulartemplates1.PNG" alt="">
    <p>
        You define a component's view with its companion <b>template</b>. A template is a form of HTML that tells Angular how to render
        the component. A template looks like regular HTML, except for a few differences.
        An HTML template contains Angularized markup and Web Components, the HTML is rendered dynamic by injecting functionality
        thanks to JavaScript. Angular is HTML6 today. 
    </p>
    <h3>Angular CLI get started for the Tour Of Heroes</h3>
    <p>
      To enable you to rapidly <b>create a new Angular 2 project</b> we can use the tool: <b>Angular CLI</b>. Open up your terminal, bash or command
      prompt and type in: <b>important: both Angular CLI and your generated project have dependencies that require Node 4 or higher, together with NPM 3 or higher.</b>
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        npm install -g angular-cli
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Usage: lists all the available features</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        ng help
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Generate and serve an Angular 2 project via a development server</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        ng new MY_AWESOME_NEW_ANGULAR2_PROJECT_NAME
        cd MY_AWESOME_NEW_ANGULAR2_PROJECT_NAME
        ng serve
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.</p>
    <p>You can configure the default HTTP port and the one used by the LiveReload server with two command-line options:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4201 --live-reload-port 49153
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h4>Generating Components, Directives, Pipes and Services</h4>
    <p>You can use the <b>ng generate</b> (or just <b>ng g</b>) command to generate Angular components</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        ng generate component my-new-hero-component
        ng g component my-new-hero-component # using the alias
        # components support relative path generation
        # if in the directory src/app/feature and you run
        ng g component new-awesome-component
        # your component will be generated in the src/app/feature/new-awesome-component
        # but if you were to run
        ng g component ../newer-more-awesome-component
        # your component will be generated in src/app/newer-more-awesome-component 
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <b>You can find all possible blueprints below</b>
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
      COMPONENT: ng g component my-new-awesome-component
      DIRECTIVE: ng g directive my-new-awesome-directive
      PIPE:      ng g pipe my-new-awesome-pipe
      SERVICE:   ng g service my-new-awesome-service
      CLASS:     ng g class my-new-awesome-class
      INTERFACE: ng g interface my-new-awesome-interface
      ENUM:      ng g enum my-new-awesome-enum
      MODULE:    ng g module my-new-awesome-module 
      </code>
      </pre>
    <p>
      <b>Generating a route</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Generating routes in the CLI has been disabled for the time being. A new router and new route generation blueprints are coming.
      You can read the official documentation for the new Router: <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html" target="_blank">
      Read More Router Here</a>. Please note that even though route generation is disabled, building your projects with routing is still fully supported.
    </p>
    <p><b>Creating a build</b></p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        ng build
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      the build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory
    </p>
    <p><b>Build Targets and Environment Files</b></p>
    <p>ng build can specify both a build target (--target=production or --target=development) and an environment file to be used
      with that build (--environment=dev or --environment=prod). By default, the development build target and environment are used.
    </p>
    <p>The mapping used to determine which environment file is used can be found in <b>angular-cli.json</b></p>
     <pre>
       <code>
         "environments": {{'{'}}
              "source": "environments/environment.ts",
              "dev":    "environments/environment.ts",
              "prod":   "environments/environment.prod"
              {{'}'}}
       </code>
     </pre>
     <p>These options also apply to the serve command. If you do not pass a value for environment, it will default to <b>dev</b>
     for development and <b>prod</b> for production.</p>
     <pre>
       <code>
         #these are equivalent
         ng build --target=production --environment=prod
         ng build --prod --env=prod
         ng build --prod
         #and so are these
         ng build --target=development --environment=dev
         ng build --dev --e=dev
         ng build --dev
         ng build
       </code>
     </pre>
      <p>You can also add your own env files other than <b>dev</b> and <b>prod</b> by doing the following:</p>
      <p>
        create a src/environments/environment.NAME.ts
        add {{'{'}}"NAME": 'src/environments/environment.NAME.ts' {{'}'}} to the app[0].environments object in <b>angular-cli.json</b>
        use them via the --env=NAME flag on the build/serve commands.
      </p>
      <p><b>Base tag handling in index.html</b></p>
      <p>When building you can modify base tag (&lt;base href="/"&gt;) in your index.html with --base href your-url option.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          #Sets base tag href to /myUrl/ in your index.html
          ng build --base-href /myUrl/
          ng build --base-href /myUrl/
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p><b>Bundling</b></p>
      <p>All builds make use of bundling, and using the --prod flag in the ng build --prod or ng serve --prod will also make use
        of uglifying and tree-shaking functionality. Read more about these sophisticated, advanced features in the <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
      </p>
      <p><b>Running unit tests</b></p>
      <p>ng test</p>
      <p>Tests will execute after a build is executed via <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html" target="_blank">Karma</a>, and it will automatically watch your files for changes. You can
        run tests a single time via --watch=false or --single-run. You can run tests with coverage via --code-coverage. The coverage
        reports will be in the coverage/ directory. Linting during tests is also available via the --lint flag. See 
        <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#linting-and-formatting-code" target="_blank">Linting and formatting code</a>
        chapter for more informations. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Running end-to-end test</b></p>
      <p>ng e2e</p>
      <p>Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.</p>
      <p>End-to-end tests are run via <a href="http://www.protractortest.org/#/" target="_blank">Protractor</a></p>.
      <p><b>Now it's time to code ...</b></p>
